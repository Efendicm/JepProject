JEOPARDY SERVER INTERFACE DOC---
once you make an instance of JepServer, you must make a new Thread and set it as the Thread's target:
    JepServer server=new JepServer();
    Thread netWorker=new Thread(server);
Then you can start the thread to do enable clients to connect to the server:
            netWorker.start();
Additionally, you can simply call the following methods directly from an instance of JepClient:
    
    String getIpAddress();
        -returns the ip address of the current machine.
        -does not actually need to be connected to the internet to work.
        -returns "err" if there is an error somehow (there shouldn't be).

    void setScore(int player,int score);
        -sets the score of player# player to score.

    void setScores(int[] scores);
        -sets all the players scores to the corresponding values in scores[].
        -scores should contain three elements; fewer will result in the value of the excluded players
        remaining constant, more will result in only the first three values being used.

    String[] getNames();
        -returns a String[3] containing the current names of the game's players.
        -the name of any given player is located at getNames()[playerNumber-1].
        -for finding the scores of the players, see getScores();

    int[] getScores();
        -returns an int[3] containing the current scores of the game's players.
        -the score of any given player is located at getScores()[playerNumber-1].
        -for finding the names of the players, see getNames();

*I tried to make the server as idiot-proof as possible; hopefully, nothing can crash it.
No promises.

**Always make a thread for the server, even if you use the thread-less methods. 
Making a dedicated thread is how the server is able to respond to every incoming connection.
On that note, hopefully nobody ever tries to DDoS this game.
